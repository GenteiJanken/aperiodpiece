I had a dream where Joseph Gordon-Levitt and I  defrauded a hotel. A fine pair of dandies were we; I was the Prince of Egypt and he was my valet. Our plan: to release a streak of tigers into a subway car. Unfortunately, we were foiled by the Egyptian Secret Police — the Dirty Dozen — who, when faced with a moral dilemma that would leave even a Jesuit streets behind, chose to uncouple the tiger train from the main car. Never trust Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
